                <div class="question"><h3>What is HTML?</h3></div>
                <div class="answer"><p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code 
                    that is used to structure a web page and its 
                    content. For example, content could be structured 
                    within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted 
                    points, or using images and data tables. As the 
                    title suggests, this article will give you a basic 
                    understanding of HTML and its functions.</p></div>

                <div class="answer"><p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code that 
                    styles web content. CSS basics walks through 
                    what you need to get started. We'll answer 
                    questions like: How do I make text red? How do 
                    I make content display at a certain location in 
                    the (webpage) layout? How do I decorate my 
                    webpage with background images and colors?</p>

                <div class="question"><h3>What is JavaScript?</h3></div>
                <div class="answer"><p>JavaScript is a programming 
                    language that adds interactivity to your website. 
                    This happens in games, in the behavior of responses 
                    when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms;
                     with dynamic styling; with animation, etc. This 
                     article helps you get started with JavaScript and 
                     furthers your understanding of what is possible.</p>

                <div class="question"><h3>What is React.js?</h3></div>
                <div class="answer"><p>React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) 
                    is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for 
                    building user interfaces based on UI components. 
                    It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a 
                    community of individual developers and companies. 
                    React can be used as a base in the development of single-page, 
                    mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks 
                    like Next.js. However, React is only concerned with state 
                    management and rendering that state to the DOM, so creating 
                    React applications usually requires the use of additional 
                    libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side 
                    functionality.</p>

                <div class="question"><h3>What is Node.js?</h3></div>
                <div class="answer"><p>Node.js is an open-source, 
                    cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime 
                    environment that runs on a JavaScript Engine 
                    (i.e. V8 engine) and executes JavaScript code 
                    outside a web browser, which was designed to 
                    build scalable network applications. Node.js lets 
                    developers use JavaScript to write command line 
                    tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts
                     server-side to produce dynamic web page content 
                     before the page is sent to the user's web browser.
                      Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript 
                      everywhere" paradigm, unifying web-application 
                      development around a single programming language, 
                      rather than different languages for server-side and 
                      client-side scripts.</p>
